Challenges: Create a fake headline, swap pictures, or create an exquisite corpse

Question: Did you just "hack" the website? Can it really be that easy? 

### Basics of the Web

### What Are Websites Made Of?

The Internet has its roots in information sharing for academic research projects. The commercialization of the internet helped drive many innovations that might have been secondary priority for academics but essential features for consumers and business, such as changeable fonts and streaming video. 

One could populate the internet entirely with text `.txt` files containing the world's information, but it would not be interactive and be a visually dull experience. It would still be useful (like a phonebook), but nobody reads phonebooks for fun. Markup languages breathe life into our favorite web pages! These are the languages you need to know!

<dl>
  <dt>HTML</dt>
  <dd>HyperText Markup Language: Organizing Information</dd>  
  <dt>CSS</dt>
  <dd>Cascading StyleSheets: Arranging and Changing Information Appearance</dd>  
  <dt>Javascript</dt>
  <dd>Brings Information to life</dd>
</dl>

_Why do we need 3 languages?_
> Using different languages for different tasks reflects a design philosophy called **modularization**. There are hacky ways to make some languages do the jobs of others (such as using Javascript to change text color or using HTML to control page styling /layout ), but doing this is discouraged. Modularization makes code easier to understand by humans. It also makes splitting up work for teams more convenient. Clearly written code is easier to debug (fix), maintain, and improve.
