##HTML Components
Information can be organized in terms of chunks. HTML is a way to organize those chunks in a standard way.

Essential HTML components for text.

```html
    <h1>This is a top level header. You can do h1 down to h6. </h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>This is an ordered list, where order matters.</li>
        <li>This is a list item.</li>
    </ol>
    <!-- This is a comment. It won't show up. on the web page.-->
```
